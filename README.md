# Credit-Risk-Clustering

Credit Risk Research Project – Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR)
Libraries used: pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.
This project uses the Taiwan Credit Default dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build and evaluate models that classify whether a credit card client will default in the following month.

This project explores predictive modeling for credit default risk using Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) alongside traditional methods like Logistic Regression and Random Forests.

The workflow includes:

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering – Cleaning, encoding, and handling class imbalance.

Model Development – Baseline logistic regression, ensemble methods, and PLTR for improved interpretability.

Model Evaluation – Model performance was assessed using accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE, and confusion matrices and practical applicability.

Governance & Interpretability – Clear documentation, segment-level insights, and model cards for transparency.

The PLTR approach combines decision tree segmentation with penalized logistic regression in each leaf, delivering a balance of predictive strength and explainability — making it well-suited for regulated environments like credit risk management.
